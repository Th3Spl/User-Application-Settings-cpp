# User/Application Settings in c++

Hello guys i'm Th3Spl and today i am here with a new repository commit 
some time ago i was developing an app that needed an header for handle
the user/application local settings (like the c# vs code's function)
and i noticed that there was not any good library in c++ for do that
so i decided to create it by my own, so here it is!

`Keep in mind that is a free open source made by me nothing more!`

### Languages:

- [x] C++

### How to use it

Firstable you need to drag the file into your main.cpp folder 
after the download from GitHub, then follow the steps: 

```C++
#include "UserSettings.h" //You can also rename the file but you also need to change the name here in this line!
```
