# User/Application Settings in c++

Hello guys i'm Th3Spl and today i am here with a new repository commit 
some time ago i was developing an app that needed an header for handle
the user/application local settings (like the c# vs code's function)
and i noticed that there was not any good library in c++ for do that
so i decided to create it by my own, so here it is!

[`Keep in mind that i did this alone and it's also an open source so pls 
id you notice something wrong or maybe you can make it better i will accept
all the fork requests`]
