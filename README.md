# User/Application Settings in c++

Hello guys i'm Th3Spl and today i am here with a new repository commit 
some time ago i was developing an app that needed an header for handle
the user/application local settings (like the c# vs code's function)
and i noticed that there was not any good library in c++ for do that
so i decided to create it by my own, so here it is!

`Keep in mind that is a free open source made by me nothing more!`
